    <h1> Welcome to my Space Battle page </h1>
    <h2> Sorry this game is not phone friendly - play on a tablet or computer</h2>
        <h2> Open the console  log to play 
        <br> ( thats opt + cmd + J if on a mac using chrome)</h2>
        <h2> Or click view, go to developer, click javascript console. </h2>
        <h2> opt + command + K for firefox or go to tools, web developer, web console </h2>
        <h2> Sroll to the top when opened.</h2>
            <h3> Currently you have to type your moves into the console log - the enemy will automatically return fire if there are any left</h3>
            <h3> You can type - or copy and paste commands from below straight into the console log window off to the side.</h3><hr>
            <h3> youHero is how you access your ship - (The USS Schwarzenegger) <hr>
            <br> The bad guys will have random attributes each time 
            <br> They all are named al something
            <br> al1 = new Alienship("AL #1") ...  al2 = new Alienship("AL #2") ... al3 = new Alienship("AL #3") ...  al4 = new Alienship("AL #4")  ... al5 = new Alienship("AL #5") ... & final "boss" ...  al6 = new Alienship("AL #6") </h3>
            <hr>
                <h4> You can shoot them with a laser (youHero.laser() ) - (weak but unlimited) or missles (youHero.attack() ) - (stronger but a finite resource)</h4>
                <h4> If you are getting beat up you can have your engineers search Reddit for a way to fix your hull. This can only be used a limited number of times.</h4>
            <h3> <div class="moves"> ** Moves & Instructions Are Below **</h3> </div>  
                <div class="controls"><h4> To attack first ship with lasers use/type youHero.laser(al1)</h4>
                <h4> To attack first ship with missles use/type youHero.attack(al1)</h4>
                <h4> To laser or missle the second ship replace al1 above with al2</h4>
                <h4> It is the same with subsequent enemies... al3 ... al4 ... al5 ... al6</h4>
                <h4> youHero.laser(al2)  ... youHero.laser(al3 ) or youHero.attack(al1) ... youHero.attack(al2) and so on ... </h4>
                <h4> To check your hull strength (health) use/type youHero.announceHealth()</h4>
                <h4> To repair your hull use/type youHero.useReddit() and your engineers will search Reddit for a way to fix the damage.... you only get to use twice</h4> 
                <h4> Can you save the Earth and destroy all 6 nasty Alien ships ? </h4>
                <h4> Please ignore when undefined appears in the log _-_ HOWEVER _-_ if your moves only return undefined then either you are targeting a dead ship or you have died please reset to play again (refresh the page).</h4>
                 <h4> Your commands must end with a () empty to fix hull or check your health ..... you put (the target) inside parenthesis to attack like above.</h4>
                 <h4> If you are typing correctly it should auto-complete to some degree in console log</h4>
